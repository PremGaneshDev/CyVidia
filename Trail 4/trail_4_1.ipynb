      "47  Concerns over the need to better control and protect sensitive information have given rise to a new set of solutions aimed at increasing an enterprise’s ability to protect its information assets. These solutions vary in their capabilities and methodologies, but collectively they have been placed in a category known as data leak prevention (DLP). It provides a comprehensive approach covering people, processes, and systems that identify, monitor, and protect data in use (e.g., endpoint actions), data in motion (e.g., network actions), and data at rest (e.g., data storage) through deep content inspection and with a centralized management framework. Most DLP solutions include a suite of technologies that facilitate three key objectives:\\n- Locate and catalogue sensitive information stored throughout the enterprise\\n- Monitor and control the movement of sensitive information across enterprise\\nnetworks\\n- Monitor and control the movement of sensitive information on end-user systems   \n",
